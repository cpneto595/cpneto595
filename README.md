I'm cpn
I started coding in Turbo Pascal in the early 90's and then played a little with Assembly and Turbo C. 
In the beginning of the next century (2001) I learned Java at University but dropped it before the 
middle of the course to live in another country. But coding is just a small thing between my many
talents.

CpN.. Since 1991 on a TK90 with Basic as OS
